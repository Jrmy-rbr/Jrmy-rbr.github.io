Here is a list of interesting web apps I've found while spending time on the internet

### Environment related

- Check the CO2 that each country's electric production system emits: [Electricity Maps](https://app.electricitymaps.com/map)
- Compare the cars' CO2 emissions (including electric cars) depending on the country where the car is used, and other parameters: [Climobil](https://climobil.connecting-project.lu/)
- Get some weather-related information on a nice map, like the temperatures, windspeed, air pressure, and a lot more: [Ventusky](https://www.ventusky.com/)

### Some open-source projects I like

- If you feel that youtube's algorithm makes you watch uninteresting and time-hogging videos, try out [Tournesol.app](https://tournesol.app/). You can use their [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tournesol-extension/) or [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tournesol-extension/nidimbejmadpggdgooppinedbggeacla) extensions to get other recommendations directly on YouTube's home page. You can also help them by comparing videos on their [website](https://tournesol.app/).

- If you want to know more about the food product you buy, go checkout [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/). They provide information about nutrition, but also about the environmental impact of many common products and brands. 

### Math

- A classic, answer all your math questions and more with [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/).
- An open-source (partial) alternative to Wolfram Alpha: [Sympy-Live](https://live.sympy.org/), [SageMathCell](https://sagecell.sagemath.org/), or [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/)
- A calculator allowing you to use "infinitely large" numbers: [Inf](https://jrmy-rbr.github.io/inf/) or its original implementation [here](https://www.lightandmatter.com/calc/inf/).

### Misc

- Track in real-time, and on an interactive map, where airplanes are currently flying: [ADS-B Exchange](https://globe.adsbexchange.com/) and [Flight Radar](https://www.flightradar24.com/)
